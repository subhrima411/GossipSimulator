Various topologies implemented in the project are:

1. Line Topology
2. Full topology
3. 2D Topology
4. Imperfect 2D Topology

Algorithms Implemented are:

Push-Sum Algorithm.
Gossip Simulator.

All the topologies and the algorithms are working as desired. 

The highest number of nodes for the topologies with which the algorithms were implemented:-

Topology     Highest Number of Nodes
Line		2000 (After that it never converges)
Full		5000 (After which it takes a lot of time)
2D		10000
Imp2D		10000
